# Images Directory

The following images are required for the website:

1. `logo.png` - The Qigong Infused Yoga logo (circular logo with Yin-Yang symbol)
2. `lynne.jpg` - Portrait photo of Lynne Nicole Smith
3. `testimonials-zoom.jpg` - Grid image of Zoom class participants

**Note:** If you have existing images with different names, you can either:
- Rename them to match the filenames above, OR
- Update the image paths in `app/page.tsx` to match your existing filenames

Currently in this directory:
- Asset-18.webp (might be the logo - rename to logo.png if so)
- Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-2.27.01-PM-768x879.png (might be Lynne's photo - rename to lynne.jpg if so)
- Zoomshot-1024x582.jpg (likely the Zoom testimonials - rename to testimonials-zoom.jpg if so)
